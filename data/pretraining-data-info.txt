A list of the subdirectories and their respective number of files can be found in NumberOfFilesBBBC022.txt

Subdirectories in the 2016-01-19-screens-bbbc022/ directory are organized with the pattern: {screen_number}-{class_name}/.
For training, the data needs to be reorganized so that the classes may be merged together. Use ../scripts/merge_classes.py for this.
